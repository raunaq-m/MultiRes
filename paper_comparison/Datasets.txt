3 datasets were used for evaluation in the paper.
1. 11poptot.fasta : A simulated data containing 11 strains of HIV-1 sequence (9181 kb) in length. 10 of these strains are generated from a single HIV-1 reference sequence by introducing random mutations on it. 
2. HCV virus sequences: The E1/E2 region of the Hepatitis C Virus was used to generate two datasets:
	One contained 36 HCV strains found in different patients, and reads were simulated from it.

	Second contained 44 HCV strains found in a patient

3. 5 HIV-1 laboratory mixture: A laboratory mixture of 5 HIV-1 strains.
