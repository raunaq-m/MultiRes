This file explains the parameter settings used for Variant Calling comparison
We only compared SNP calls made by each of the variant caller method. 
1. LoFreq (Version 2.1.2, last downloaded May 19 2015)
USAGE: 
lofreq call -f <referencefile> -o <output.vcf> <bamfile>


2. ShoRAH (Last downloaded November 2013)
USAGE : 
python shorah.py -b <bamfile> -f <fastareferencefile>

3. VPhaser-2 (Last downloaded: October 24 2015) 
USAGE: Default settings
./bin/variant_caller -i <inputsortedbamfile> -o <outputFolder>

For all the SNPs called by a method, the vcf files / variant file (generated by V-Phaser) / SNP file ( generated by ShoRAH), we wrote a custom script to analyze and compare the variant calls to the ground truth. 
Custom script: compare_SNVs.pl

USAGE: 
For MultiRes prediction comparision:
perl compare_SNVs.pl -gt <groundtruth.vcf> -mr "MultiRes.vcf file" -t 0.1 

For LoFreq prediction comparision:
perl compare_SNVs.pl -gt <groundtruth.vcf> -lf "Lofreq.vcf file"

For ShoRAH prediction comparison:
perl compare_SNVs.pl -gt <groundtruth.vcf> -sh "Shorah snv file"

For VPhaser-2 prediction comparison:
perl compare_SNVs.pl -gt <groundtruth.vcf> -vp "Vphaser output file"
